# Movie Rank - A movie difficulty scorer for English learner
## Sherry Pan


### Motivation
***
What's the most fun way to learn English?
If you're tired of going to classes or reading a book, there's noting better than learning English through movies.

By watching movies, learners will get to learn REAL English conversations in context but not textbook English. Moreover, they get to hear how things are said like the tone of voice.

However, selecting a movie that matches the learner's current English level is not always obvious. A wrong match may lead to a frustrating and dissatisfying experience.

The goal of this capstone project is to build a scorer that rates English movie difficulty and extracts the keywords using various natural language processing techniques.
